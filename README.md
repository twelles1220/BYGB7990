The following python program is one that was used last semester to pull relevent product prices off of the Wegmans grocery store website.

It was used to chart the change in price over a month of a select products using Python and Selenium.

The Selenium Code rips the data from the Fresh Fruit, Fresh Veggies, Meat, Fish, and Dairy pages of Wegman's site. For this site I actually had to split the different types of meat given how the site was set up.

The Python code is used to congregate said data into a nice spreadsheet that we then used to chart potential pricing trends.
